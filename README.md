## CSGO Account Website Base

I made this site originally under private commission, the original commisioner did not end up using the project and development was halted. 
It is now public and serves as a stepping stone in learning full-stack development.

## LIVE DEMO
https://csgo-smurf.vercel.app/

Stack:
- NodeJS (14.0)
- NextJS
- Tailwind
- Sanity
- Stripe

## TODO
- Finish cart design
- Finish Stripe JS implementation 
- Finish routing checkout

## POTENTIONAL
- Rewrite with SvelteKit + Firebase for a smoother & better way to handle account listings. (Current issue right now is that Sanity does not provide on the fly requests for when an account has been sold, and this means the same account can be sold to multiple people in the span of the update time.)
